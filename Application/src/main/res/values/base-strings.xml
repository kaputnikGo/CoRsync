            This app demonstrates using SyncAdapter to fetch background data for an app that
            doesn\'t require a user-visible account type or 2-way synchronization.

            \n\nThis app periodically (to be defined downloads the feed from CoR Adviser feeds and
            caches the data in a content provider. At runtime, the cached feed data is displayed
            inside a ListView.
